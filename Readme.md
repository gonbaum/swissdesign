Imitation of swiss style branding desing using CSS Grid and Flexbox

I decided to replicate a design i found in google when looking for swiss style design examples (https://es.99designs.com/blog/design-history-movements/swiss-design/).
Swiss design is known for their use of grids, among other characteristics. With CSS Grid, you can have lots of fun trying to imitate some designs.

This is the design I tried to replicate:
